Class scrreprt Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrreprt)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrreprt)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrreprt)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrreprt)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrreprt)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrreprt)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrreprt)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrreprt)              features and been removed from others.
(scrreprt)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrreprt)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
(scrreprt)              a package that still implements the
(scrreprt)              deprecated \float@addtolist interface .

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
